# SlitherlinkBoard

This is a simple Python / Kivy program to play Slitherlink.  It is only the board.  It does not create puzzles.  It does not solve puzzles.  It does not check solutions.

You will need to supply a valid puzzle.  I suggest [Krazy Dad](https://krazydad.com/slitherlink/).

When you first run the program, the board will be blank.  Enter the puzzle's numbers into the matching cells by clicking the cells; once for one, twice to two, thrice for three, and four times for zero.  A fifth click will take the cell back to blank.  When all the numbers are entered, click "NUMBER LOCK" to lock the numbers to prevent accidentally changing them while trying to solve the puzzle.

Clicking the lines betixt the cells changes their color from grey to black, to pink, and back to grey.

With the number lock on, you can click a cell to change its color from white to yellow, or yellow to white.  I found a website on the [Parity Method](http://home.windstream.net/windhams/Games/Puzzles/SolvingSlitherlink.html) to help solve the puzzles and have found it useful.
